# signDNE: A MATLAB package for ariaDNE and its sign-oriented extension.


The ariaDNE function automatically search for files with the suffix "_watertight"
to use for ray tracing. 

If such a file doesn't exists, it will use the given mesh for ray casting.

Watertight mesh versions can be generated by using the script below. 


## Mesh Preprocessing Script: "preprocess.py"

This script preprocesses 3D mesh files by making them watertight and performing cleanup operations.

### Example
Example of preprocessing and generating watertight versions of all files in a folder.
```
python preprocess.py data/
```
